										<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
										<p>I and my friends have a project idea of making an application for smartphones providing information about cars. We will collect the data about the cars from many brands, analyze them and show the users what they really mean. This application will not be used for buying or trading cars, it will only be used to show and analyze the cars data. Through this app, we hope people will have a clearer view of those statistics of the cars.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Motivations</h3>
												<p>There are more than 40 million of motorbikes used in Vietnam, which makes Vietnam the country that owns the second most motorbike in the world. We want Vietnam to be a more civilized country by reducing the amount of motorcycles and introducing cars to the people. Many Vietnamese people are not very familiar with the data about cars, so we want to make this application to provide them with the information.</p>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Description</h3>
												<p>This app is only used to showing information to the users. We will show you what the data, the numbers really mean. We already know much about the cars statistics, so this arenâ€™t a really big problem. We will allow you to enter your requirement of a car such as the look, the price, or even if it is environmentally friendly or not, then we will show you the cars that suit your needs. But you will not be able to buy or trade anything through our app. If you need buy cars, you have to access to other pages or applications. At first, to let people know our product, we will make an advertisement as a marketing and post it on other pages or games as a step for gamers to take some extra rewards. When it is used by quite many users, we will allow others to advertise their products on our app.<br><br> Our biggest problem so far is how to ask for permission from the car brands without having to pay a lot of money. We will have to persuade them to understand the project that we are doing on and not report our product. We will not really have any benefits from this project. This is just for the users. </p>

											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
												<p>We, as a team, will be using JavaScript because this application will be available on both Android and IOS operation system. We will collect data from a lot of source, which means the license or permission from those car industries is extremely important.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Skills required</h3>
												<p>We have to use effectively the programming language like JavaScript and understand how it works to write the programs. We have to collaborate well with every member in the team, assign suitable work for teammates so that they can do their best. We also have to describe the data collected in the simplest way possible for everybody to understand. Last but not least, we have to have great communication skills to talk with the representatives of the brands about the ownership of the cars</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>We will provide clear information for Vietnamese (and also other countries) people about cars. We hope they will have a car that is suitable for their needs and therefore reduce the amount of motorbikes used in Vietnam. </p>
