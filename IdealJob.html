												<h3>MY CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE PLAN</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	I don't have much experience in game testing, but I do love mobile games, especially those are played by a lot of people. About the teamwork skill, I cooperative with others quite effectively. Our projects in the past, either huge or smalls ones, were always great.<br> I can analyze the data quite well, but I'm not sure if I can handle the bugs and glitches or not.<br>
											I'm still trying to code well, so that I will be able to fix the bugs and errors in any applications. I will study harder to achieve highest score as possible to make my CV look nicer. I will try to apply as a game tester in my second or third year to gain more experience and reach there requirement about the year of experience.
