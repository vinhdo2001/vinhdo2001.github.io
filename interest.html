										<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Since I was 14, 15 years old, I have been interested in IT, especially about the game industry. I like to not only play games, but also contribute to the game industry by making games or becoming a game tester. I am deeply keen on developing games after a series of success of Vietnamese players on world events, like Team Flash from VN won the Arena of Valor 2019 world tournament or in League of Legends, Vietnam region became a major region. <br>
									But, my coding is just at a beginner level. I am trying very hard to familiarize myself with it. I am quite good at math and solving logical problems, so I think I am suitable for studying IT.</p>
									<p>I choose to study at RMIT mainly because this University is famous for its School of Technology and Science. The facilities, especially the labs here are very good, definitely better than those in Vienamese universities. 
									Besides, graduating from an international university like RMIT makes my CV look fancier and make it easier for me to find a job.</p>
									<p>What I expect to learn during my studies are how to do the coding more efficiently, how to make an application on either computer orsmartphone or any devices. I also want to learn to manage the whole network system of an industry. I want to learn to hack, too. (Of course just for fun)   </p>
